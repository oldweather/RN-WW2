# RN-WW2

Weather observations rescued from RN WW2 logs. This is the basic data behind [Marine observations of old weather](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/2008BAMS2522.1)

If you are looking for weather observations, you don't need this: all these observations are in [ICOADS](http:icoads.noaa.gov). You don't need this unless you are interested in the provenance or origin of these particular observations.

This is an old dataset. In particular it predates my realisation that configuration control was important for this sort of thing; so it's a mess. (I have re-assembled it as best I can from various backups). Don't expect to just download and use it - doing anything with this will be *work*.

However it *does* include the IMMA records sent to ICOADS; the original, as-digitised, records from which they were made; and the code used to do the conversion. So if we need to revisit these observations, it is at least possible.
